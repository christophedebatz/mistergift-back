### mg-back ###
**Introduction**
mg-back is the back-end project of Mister Gifts version 2. It includes Rest API and database access. Used technologies are Java EE 8 with Spring 4 (Core, Security and Data (with JPA)) and QueryDSL. The used DBMS is currently MySQL 5. We have not the need of a node sql database yet. Maybe later.

**Deployment**
```
$ ./path/to/mg-back/execute.sh
```

Tendresse & chocolate.
